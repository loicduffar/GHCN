# GHCN
exploration and extraction of daily GHCN climatological data (Global Historiocal Climatologic Network)

This notebook reads the 3 inventory files, and displays the informations in a single browser (station, country, period by parameter), allowing to apply filter (e.g. select country and/or stations). In addition a graph is plotted representing the number of stations for each year, and a map is displayed to show the station locations. Outputs can be saved in an excel file.
